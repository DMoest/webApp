# Detect and use swipe events on mobile devices

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mosbth/detect-swipe-event.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mosbth/detect-swipe-event)

A JavaScript function which detects swipe events and calls a callback where you can take actions on swipe events like up, down, left, right.

There is a sample in the code on how to use the function.


```
